About the Dataset

Dataset used for developing and testing a predictive model of student academic performance using machine learning.
Key questions explored:

Which factors most influence students’ final academic performance?

Can machine learning reliably predict Pass/Fail outcomes based on these factors?

How accurately can the model forecast continuous exam scores?

How can such predictions support data-driven interventions in education?

Final dataset version includes socio-demographic and academic attributes for each student record.
 Data cleaning and encoding scripts finalized (no missing values detected).

This dataset provides insights into academic performance drivers among students by analysing behavioural, demographic, and socio-economic attributes.

Dataset Overview

This dataset was compiled from a publicly available Kaggle student performance dataset and adapted for research purposes.
Each record represents a unique student, including personal, academic, and behavioural indicators.

Total Records: 708
Variables: 10 core features + derived attributes for analysis

Key Features
Demographic & Socio-Economic Details

Student_ID – Unique identifier for each student record

Gender – Student’s gender (Male/Female)

Parental_Education_Level – Highest education attained by either parent (High School, Bachelors, Masters, PhD)

Internet_Access_at_Home – Indicates whether the student has reliable home internet access (Yes/No)

Academic & Behavioural Features

Study_Hours_per_Week – Average weekly study hours

Attendance_Rate (%) – Percentage of classes attended

Past_Exam_Scores – Average score from previous examinations

Extracurricular_Activities – Participation in school clubs, sports, or community activities (Yes/No)

Final_Exam_Score – Numerical score (0–100) in the final examination

Pass_Fail – Categorical label derived from the final exam score:

Pass → Final_Exam_Score ≥ 60

Fail → Final_Exam_Score < 60

Analytical Focus

The dataset was utilized to:

Build supervised machine learning models (Random Forest).

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.

Evaluate model reliability using F1-score, RMSE, and R² metrics.

Generate feature importance rankings and deploy a prediction app prototype using Streamlit.
